Here you will be able to access materials such as readings, data sets, and the lab manual. The website also includes helpful links and resources for each of the course topics. The resources that accompany this website include: A lab manual PDF copy available here Data sets used in the lab manual: TinkerPlots 3 Data Files You can read more about these resources in the introduction.
