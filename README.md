This GitHub repository is the home for the book _Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty_. It includes the TinkerPlots&#8482; data used in the book, as well as the errata for all editions. The materials in the book are based on the NSF-funded [CATALST Project](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~catalst/) (DUE-0814433).

Revisions to the Third Edition
------

The third edition (the red book) has several changes. Below are some of the major changes:

- The end of Unit 1 has been restructured to include more practice carrying out one-sample hypothesis tests. The _Matching Dogs_ course activity was removed and statistical testing is introduced via the _Helper and Hinderer_ course activity. Additional practice is provided in a new course activity, _Monday Breakups_. Finally, another new course activity, _Racial Bias_, extends testing to models that are not uniform.
- Unit 2 has been re-sequenced. The course activity _Sampling_ was moved into this unit to focus the end of this unit on the scope of inferences that can be made from the study design. 
- The _Features of Distributions_ course activity was moved into Unit 3. This makes a natural transition to the _Standard Deviation_ course activity. This is where precision and uncertainty are introduced via the standard error as well.
- All homework assignments have been removed from the book.
